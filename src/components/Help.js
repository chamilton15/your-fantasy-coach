      <h2>How to Use the Chatbot</h2>
      <p>
        Our chatbot is designed to assist with weekly fantasy football lineup decisions.
        You can ask questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Should I start Player A or Player B this week?"</li>
        <li>"Who is a better FLEX option in PPR format?"</li>
        <li>"Which defense has the best matchup this week?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The chatbot uses data-driven analysis to provide the best recommendations based
        on your unique team roster.
      </p>
